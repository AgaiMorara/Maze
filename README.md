This is my introduction to graphics... I use the SDL api to interact with  graphics and the keyboard...(audio later)
The mission is to make a labyrinth like those in a real-game... where the moving sprite or player can move around without colliding with objects
They should also interact with the objects within a specified number of rulesets
*The main concept used is Raycasting: Drawing vertical lines and shading them to make walls... from the distance  a square object on a 
grid is from  the users point of view.
